Hi all,

First,sorry for my poor English.

I want to introduce myself,i am a Chinese boy,my English nickname is: Gavin.h.

I'm joining SETI@home since 2 Jul 2006,
i also joined 2011 China Drumbeat Hackfest,
i am a member of Equn.org,which is new website of Equn.com.

I'm interesting in volunteer computing.I have two questions,it is about duty and anonymous.

I'm preparing to organize a group or a company,
use BOINC to develop a project,which project name is volunteer@home(v AT h).

We plan to spread the news of volunteer computing in china,and develop volunteer timing.

Any ideas or questions are welcome,contact me through Email:859956006@qq.com.

Thanks!

Regards

Gavin.H
