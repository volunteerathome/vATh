I'm joining seti@home since 2 Jul 2006,i also joined 2011 China Drumbeat Hackfest,i am a member of equn.org,which is new website of equn.com.

I'm interesting in volunteercomputing.I have two quetions,it is about duty and anonymou.

I'm preparing to organize a group or a company,use BOINC to devlope a project,which project name is volunteer@home(vATh).
